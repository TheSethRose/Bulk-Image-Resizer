# Bulk-Image-Resizer
Bulk Image Resizer is a Python script that allows you to resize multiple images in a folder while maintaining their aspect ratio. This is particularly useful when you have a collection of high-resolution images that you'd like to convert to a smaller size for web usage, sharing, or printing.
